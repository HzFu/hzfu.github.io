<h3>Co-saliency Detection [<a href="proj_cosal_review.html"><font color="#ff0000">Details</font></a>]</h3>
<p>
Co-saliency is used to discover the common saliency on the multiple images. This page provides some related papers about the co-saliency detection. </p>

<h3>Glaucoma Screening from Fundus Image [<a href="proj_glaucoma_fundus.html"><font color="#ff0000">Details</font></a>]</h3>
<p>
Glaucoma is a chronic eye disease that leads to irreversible vision loss. The cup to disc ratio (CDR) plays an important role in the screening and diagnosis of glaucoma. Thus, the accurate and automatic segmentation of optic disc (OD) and optic cup (OC) from fundus images is a fundamental task. Most existing methods segment them separately, and rely on hand-crafted visual feature from fundus images. In this paper, we propose a deep learning architecture, named M-Net, which solves the OD and OC segmentation jointly in a one-stage multi-label system. </p>

<h3>Angle-Closure Glaucoma Screening in Anterior Segment OCT [<a href="proj_glaucoma_asoct.html"><font color="#ff0000">Details</font></a>]</h3>
<p>
Angle-closure glaucoma is a major cause of irreversible visual impairment and can be identiÔ¨Åed by measuring the anterior chamber angle (ACA) of the eye. The ACA can be viewed clearly through anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT). To address this problem, we propose a whole system for automatic AS-OCT segmentation, measurement, and screening. </p>

<h3>DeepVessel: Vessel Segmentation based on Deep Learning [<a href="proj_deepvessel.html"><font color="#ff0000">Details</font></a>]</h3>
<p>
We formulate the retinal vessel segmentation problem as a boundary detection task and solve it using a novel deep learning architecture. We combine the CNN and CRF layers into an integrated deep network, called DeepVessel, which achieves state-of-the-art retinal vessel segmentation performance. </p>

<h3>RGBD foreground segmentation [<a href="proj_rgbdseg.html"><font color="#ff0000">Details</font></a>]</h3>
<p>
We have proposed an object-based co-segmentation method for RGBD images that makes effective use of depth information. With a fully-connected graph structure and mutex constraints, our method is able to properly deal with image sets that contain noisy images with more than or less than one common foreground object.

<h3>Object-based Video Co-segmentation [<a href="proj_video_coseg.html"><font color="#ff0000">Details</font></a>]</h3>
<p>
An object-based video co-segmentation method is proposed to extract multiple foreground objects in a video set. The key contributions of this work are the multi-state selection graph (MSG) to address the problem of multiple foreground objects, and introduction of the indicator matrix.
